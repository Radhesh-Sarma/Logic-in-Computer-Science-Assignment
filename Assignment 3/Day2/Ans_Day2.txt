1) Model Exists
	Model name: 1.smv
	Model description:
	 Let Model M(S,>,L) be such a model.
	 Here > is a transition relation (binary relation on S),L is a Labelling function from S to power set of atoms
	 The states are {s1, s2}.
	 Transitions are : s1 > s2
	 				   s2 > s2
	 Labelling is as follows : L(s1) = {p}
	 						   L(s2) = {q}
	 Initial state for this example is s1
	 Here F(p) -> F(q), AF(p) -> AF(q), AG(p -> AF(q)) are all false.
