2) Equivalent
	Consider EF(phi) | EF(psi) to be true;
	Therefore, there exists a path where phi OR psi occur in a future state;
	Therefore, in that same state, (phi | psi) holds true.
	Therefore, EF(phi | psi) holds true)
	Hence, (EF(phi) | EF(psi)) -> EF(phi | psi)
	
	Now, consider EF(phi | psi) to be true;
	Then there exists a path where (phi | psi) holds true.
	Case 1: phi holds.
		Since phi holds in that state on that path, EF(phi) holds.
		Therefore, EF(phi) | EF(psi) holds.
	Case 2: psi holds.
		Since psi holds in that state on that path, EF(psi) holds.
		Therefore, EF(phi) | EF(psi) holds.
	Combining both the cases, we get EF(phi) | EF(psi) holds.
	Hence, EF(phi | psi) -> (EF(phi) | EF(psi))
	
	As the formulas imply each other, they are equivalent.
